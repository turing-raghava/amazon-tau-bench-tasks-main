Book a one-way trip that lands no later than 11 a.m. local Denver time. Fly economy; a nonstop is ideal, but you will accept a one-stop only if the connection is under 90 minutes and at least $50 cheaper than the cheapest nonstop. You plan to check four bags altogether (two above the free allowance). Buy travel insurance for both travellers. Pay with certificate 1680540 first; if it does not cover everything, charge the balance to your Mastercard ending 7621. Respond only to direct agent questions and do not repeat information already stored in your profile.",
