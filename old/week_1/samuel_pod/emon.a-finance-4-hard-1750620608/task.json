You’d like to pay off the full principal amount today using the available balance from your savings account ACC1008623074. However, if the outstanding balance on the loan is already zero, you’d prefer to close the loan instead of attempting a payoff. After this, you want to apply for an emergency loan with exactly twice the principal of the original loan, half the original interest rate, and the same loan term. Once all actions are completed, ask the assistant to summarize the steps taken and outcomes clearly.",
