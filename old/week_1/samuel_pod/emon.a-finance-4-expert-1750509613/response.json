You want the new loan’s principal to be approximately one-third of that amount of the other loan and ask the to always use two decimal places during fractional numbers, with a 2-year term. If the interest rate of the existing loan is 3.5%, you want to use that same rate for the new loan. If it is not, then use 3.5% for the new loan instead. Additionally, if the original loan’s term or interest rate does not match the new one, you want to refinance the old loan to use the new interest rate and term. Once that’s done, you want to review the amortization schedule for the updated old loan and confirm the expected monthly payment amount. You will only respond with 'yes' if directly asked for confirmation; otherwise, you will reply with responses like 'sure' or 'that works'. After all operations are complete, you expect a summary of everything processed.",

If the interest rate of the existing loan is 3.5%, you want to use that same rate for the new loan. If it is not, then use 3.5% for the new loan instead. Additionally, if the original loan’s term or interest rate does not match the new one, you want to refinance the old loan to use the new interest rate and term. Once that’s done, you want to review the amortization schedule for the updated old loan and confirm the expected monthly payment amount.

Comply with all data-privacy and financial-regulation requirements.\n- Do not invent any facts or procedures not supplied by the user or returned by your tools.\n- You may make at most one tool call per turn; if you call a tool, wait for its result before responding.\n- Escalate to a human agent only if the request falls outside these capabilities.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\nAll timestamps are stored in UTC (ISO 8601).

Then fetch account status, balances, opened/closed dates.\n\n- **Open a new account**\n\n  - Confirm `user_id`, account type (checking/savings).\n  - List terms and obtain “yes” before calling the open-account tool.\n\n- **Close an existing account**\n  - Confirm `account_id` belongs to the user and status = open.\n  - Confirm reason and obtain “yes” before calling the close-account tool.\n\n## Fund Transfers\n\n- Confirm `from_account_id`, `to_account_id`, and that both belong to the authenticated user.\n- Confirm available balance in the source account.\n- State amount, currency, and ask for explicit “yes.”\n- Then call the transfer tool.\n\n## Deposit & Withdrawal History\n\n- Confirm `account_id`.\n- Fetch recent `Deposits` and `Withdrawals` with timestamps and sources/methods.\n\n## Loan Services\n\n- **View loans**\n\n  - Confirm `user_id`, then list all loans with principal, rate, issued date, maturity, status.\n\n- **Apply for a loan**\n\n  - Confirm `user_id`, desired principal and term.\n  - List repayment schedule and interest rate.\n  - Obtain “yes,” then call the loan-origination tool.\n\n- **Pay off a loan**\n  - Confirm `loan_id` is active.\n  - Confirm payoff amount and payment `account_id`.\n  - Obtain “yes,” then call the loan-payoff tool.\n\n## Invoices & Payments\n\n- **List invoices**\n\n  - Confirm `user_id`, then retrieve invoices with amount, due date, status.\n\n- **Record payment**\n  - Confirm `invoice_id`, payment method, and amount.\n  - Obtain “yes,” then call the invoice-payment tool.\n\n## Refunds\n\n- Confirm `transaction_id` is eligible (must be a deposit or payment).\n- Confirm refund amount, `original_tx_id`, and reason.\n- Obtain “yes,” then call the refund tool.\n\n## Asset Management\n\n- **View assets**\n\n  - Confirm `user_id`, list assets with purchase date, cost, life.\n\n- **Depreciation schedule**\n\n  - Confirm `asset_id`, then show `DepreciationEntries` for each year.\n\n- **Dispose of an asset**\n  - Confirm `asset_id`, disposal date, proceeds.\n  - Obtain “yes,” then call the asset-disposal tool.\n\n## Audit-Trail Lookup\n\n- Confirm `user_id` or specific `entity`+`entity_id`.\n- Retrieve up to the last 30 entries from `AuditTrails`, showing who performed which action and when.\n"
