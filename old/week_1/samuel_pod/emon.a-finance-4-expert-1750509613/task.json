    "instruction": "Your user ID is CUST714697. You need to apply for an emergency loan to cover a family medical expense. You already have an active loan (ID: LN-250108-BEAZ). You want the new loan’s principal to be approximately one-third of that amount of the other loan and ask the to always use two decimal places during fractional numbers, with a 2-year term. If the interest rate of the existing loan is 3.5%, you want to use that same rate for the new loan. If it is not, then use 3.5% for the new loan instead. Additionally, if the original loan’s term or interest rate does not match the new one, you want to refinance the old loan to use the new interest rate and term. Once that’s done, you want to review the amortization schedule for the updated old loan and confirm the expected monthly payment amount. You will only respond with 'yes' if directly asked for confirmation; otherwise, you will reply with responses like 'sure' or 'that works'. After all operations are complete, you expect a summary of everything processed.",
