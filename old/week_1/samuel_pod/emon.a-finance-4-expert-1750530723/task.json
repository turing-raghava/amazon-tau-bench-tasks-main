In addition, you decide to take out another loan for a medical expense that is exactly double the first one in principal, interest rate, and term length. After applying for both loans, you wish to refinance your current active loan (LN-250521-TzMC) using the average interest rate and average term (in years) of the two new loans. Please ensure that all fractional values are expressed with exactly two decimal places. Once all actions are completed, you expect a detailed summary of everything that was done.",
