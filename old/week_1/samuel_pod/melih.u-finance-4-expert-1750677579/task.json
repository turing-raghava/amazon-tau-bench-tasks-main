First, you want to understand your current loan by checking its amortization schedule. Then, since interest rates have dropped significantly, you'd like to refinance this loan to a lower rate of 7.5% while keeping the same term length. After refinancing, you want to see the new amortization schedule to understand how much you'll save on monthly payments. Finally, you'd like to apply for an additional home improvement loan of $20,000 with a 36-month term at the same new rate of 7.5%. Then calculate the combined monthly payment, with the refinanced one and the new one, you'll have to pay for each month",
