You remember the personal loan had a principal around 29K and was still ongoing. You want to refinance it to a 6.9% interest over 18 months. For the new loan, you want $4000, for 2 years, at 5% interest. You don’t say 'yes' — instead, you say things like 'sure thing' or 'go ahead'. You expect the assistant to remember earlier answers and not repeat questions unnecessarily. You came across the loan ID (LN-250520-aibg) in an old email, but you won’t share it unless it keep pressering you. After all things done ask the ask to give a summary about all the request.",
