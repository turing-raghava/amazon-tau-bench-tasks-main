If that’s not possible, you want the agent to cancel the reservation so you can rebook yourself. You are also looking for the cheapest direct round trip from New York (either JFK or EWR) to Miami, departing May 20 and returning May 25. You are okay with basic economy if it’s cheaper. You want the agent to book it. You prefer to use your smaller gift card first, then your larger one. You want to use all your free baggage allowance but do not want insurance. Your date of birth is already in your user profile and you won’t provide it again.",
