You need to go to Phonix on that day with a direct flight. After arriving to the Phoenix, you'll need 2 hours for your dinner and after the dinner, you need to be at SFO within the same day. By the way, you want refund for the flights that you'll not be using. Don't buy any ticket different from another class than you have already bought. Inform me about my total cost for the flights together with the refund amount. You need to pay with the same card as I used for our previous reservation that we'll miss. Don't change baggages, and insurance. We're still 3 people.",
