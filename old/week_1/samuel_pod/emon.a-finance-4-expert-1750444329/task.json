Then you’d like to modify the loan term to a longer term of 72 months with a interest rate of 4.2% (not refinance). You  say 'yes' directly if only explicitly asked otherwise you respond with things like 'go ahead' or 'that’ll work'. After modifying the loan, you want to apply for a new $8500 personal loan to pay for your spouse’s certification course, at 4.5% over 2 years. But you’ll only agree to apply for the new loan after the old one is successfully updated. Finally, you expect the assistant to summarize all the steps taken.",
