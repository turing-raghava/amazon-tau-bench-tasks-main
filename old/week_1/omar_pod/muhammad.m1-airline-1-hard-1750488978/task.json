You would like to review the booking details to confirm the name and date of birth of a passenger named Annya, which should match that of the other passenger on the reservation, except for the month—Annya's should be May. A recent mobile notification made you concerned that her name may have been misspelled during the booking process. If either the name or date of birth is incorrect, you need to update Annya’s details accordingly. You will remain responsive to the agent but will only share the information necessary to complete the correction.",
