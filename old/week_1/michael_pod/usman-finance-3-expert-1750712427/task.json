You want to pay this invoice using your checking account (ACC1338717874) which has $11,772.21 available balance. However, before making the payment, you need to check if there are any other overdue invoices in your account that you might have missed. You also need to check for any refunds due to 'duplicate_charge' reasons. After making the payment, you realize there was a service issue with a previous transaction (TXN-20250603-5369) and you need to request a refund for the amount of $513.06 due to 'service_issue'. Then you need to check for any refunds due to 'billing_error' reasons to see if there are any processing issues. Finally, you need to update the refund status of your existing refund (RFND-5369) to 'pending' for review. You are reactive to the agent and will only provide information when asked.",
