                    "content": "A few additional tips to ensure your external transfer goes smoothly:\n\n  1. Cut-Off Times  \n     \u2022 Standard ACH transfers typically require submission by 5:00 PM local time on a business day to begin processing that same day.  \n     \u2022 Same-day or immediate transfers usually have an earlier cut-off (often around 2:00 PM).  \n\n  2. Fees  \n     \u2022 Standard ACH transfers to other banks are usually free.  \n     \u2022 Expedited or same-day transfers may incur a small fee (for example, USD $5\u2013$15). You\u2019ll see any fee clearly disclosed before you confirm.  \n\n  3. Transfer Limits  \n     \u2022 Daily limits for external transfers often range from USD $2,000 to $10,000, depending on your account tier.  \n     \u2022 If you need to send more than your daily limit, you may need to contact support or visit a branch.  \n\n  4. Confirmation & Tracking  \n     \u2022 You\u2019ll receive an email or in-app notification once the transfer is initiated.  \n     \u2022 After the beneficiary bank accepts the funds, you should get a second confirmation.  \n\n  5. Security  \n     \u2022 Never share your one-time passcode (OTP) with anyone.  \n     \u2022 If you spot any unexpected activity, please let us know right away.  \n\nIf at any point you need help\u2014or if you\u2019d like me to walk you step-by-step through the online or mobile flow\u2014just let me know. Otherwise, good luck with your transfer!",
