You prefer flights departing after 8:00 AM EST and arriving before 8:00 PM EST. You require economy class seats. You have a total of 3 baggages for the group. You prefer direct flights, but if none are available, a one-stop flight is acceptable with a layover of less than 3 hours. If multiple options exist, choose the one with the lowest total cost for economy class. You want to use your certificates to cover as much of the cost as possible, prioritizing the highest value certificate first, and pay the remaining balance with your credit card ending in 1698. You do not want insurance. You want to know total cost and payment methods for this booking. You will provide passenger details only when asked by the agent. Your birthday is in your profile, so you do not need to provide it unless requested.",
