You prefer a direct flight if available, but a one-stop flight is acceptable if it saves cost. Departure must be after 9am EST. You require business class seating due to company policy. You initially have 2 baggages, and as a gold member, you expect at least one free baggage. After booking, you realize you need to add one more baggage. You wish to use your certificates to cover as much of the initial cost as possible, prioritizing the larger certificate first, and the remaining balance with your credit card ending in 2415. If additional costs arise from updates, use the same credit card. You do not want insurance. If multiple flight options are available, choose the one with the shortest total travel time and then cost if still multiple options available.  You are responsive only to direct questions from the agent. Your personal details are in your profile, so you prefer not to provide them unless necessary.",
