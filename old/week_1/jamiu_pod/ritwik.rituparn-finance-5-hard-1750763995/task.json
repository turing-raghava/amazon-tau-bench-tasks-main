It is still in use and located at DEN Office - 5th Floor, so its status should be updated back to 'active'. The department responsible for it has changed to 'Operations', and the depreciation method used is now 'double_declining'. Its current book value is 5080, and the last maintenance was done on July 29, 2024. Also, the vendor should be updated to 'OmniTech Systems'.
