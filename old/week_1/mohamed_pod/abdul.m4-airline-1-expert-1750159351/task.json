You originally booked this trip for work, but your plans have changed and you’re now traveling for a personal vacation with a friend instead. You want to make two changes: first, downgrade your entire reservation to basic economy to save some cost; second, update the passenger information because you’ll be traveling with your friend Oliver Johnson (DOB: 1985-09-15). Keep all flights, dates, insurance, and baggage unchanged. Handle any fare difference automatically using your credit card ending in 4494.",
