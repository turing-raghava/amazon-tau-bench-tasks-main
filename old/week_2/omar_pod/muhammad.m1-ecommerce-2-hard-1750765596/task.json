For the past few days, your lab has been filled with many innovative devices, which are now polluting the environment, and you are not feeling well due to that. So, you are discarding those items or arranging their eco-friendly alternative to maintain a healthy environment. You remembered that there is an order that you might be receiving soon, where you also ordered many innovative devices. You want to first check your current order details, which are pending, and check which one belongs to supplied ID SUP007. You need to cancel all of them and leave only one. Also, the amount you get after reducing the quantity of that item, you need to adjust that by increasing the quantity of the product whose supplied ID is SUP027, which is an eco-friendly instrument, which is in the same shipping ID. Unfortunately, you don't remember the product ID and the shipping ID. You remembered that you paid for that order using a debit card.",
