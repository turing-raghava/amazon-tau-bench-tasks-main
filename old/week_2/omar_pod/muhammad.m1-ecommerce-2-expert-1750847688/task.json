You know it’s in pending status and was paid for using the cash payment method. You want to reduce the quantity of the product whose product name is Eco-Friendly Accessory with product ID PRD0910, and it is designed for durability with attention to modern aesthetics. You just got a message from your personal assistant that the PRD0910 product is from SUP092 supplier ID, which is in your pending sales order, and you want to reduce the number of products to save at least 3300, and you are planning to use that amount saved to add other items to the same order. After decreasing the quantity, you’d like to include two new items in the same sales order for your office, ensuring the total combined cost doesn’t exceed approximately 3300. One of the product names is Compact Gadget, designed for optimal performance and energy efficiency, and you are interested only in that device from a list of other Compact Gadgets, whose unit price is somewhat 362, and you want to purchase a quantity that keeps the total under 2200. The second item is a suggested product from a friend, with the product ID PRD0323, and its exact unit cost is 27.28, and its name is Portable Widget, and you intend to use the remaining funds to buy it and test it out.",
