You're incredibly excited today because you just won a lucky draw with a fascinating cash prize of 6500. Since you recently moved to the USA, you need substantial funds to set up your lab, which requires various smart gadgets. Now that you've received the money, you're planning to purchase a few essential items for your lab. First, you want to review all your order details and modify the one that is still in pending status—though you don’t remember the exact order ID, you only recall that it’s marked as pending. You intend to add three more items to that order. The first is a specific Smart Widget under the supplier ID SUP099, priced at 316.42 per unit, and you want to order enough units to total roughly half of your lucky draw amount. The second item is the Innovative Accessory under the supplier ID SUP028, and you want to ensure the number of units stays within a budget of 2300. Finally, you plan to use the remaining funds to purchase the Advanced Instrument from supplier ID SUP012.",
