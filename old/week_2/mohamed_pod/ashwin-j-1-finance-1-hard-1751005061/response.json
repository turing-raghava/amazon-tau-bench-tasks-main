Comply with all data-privacy and financial-regulation requirements.\n- Do not invent any facts or procedures not supplied by the user or returned by your tools.\n- You may make at most one tool call per turn; if you call a tool, wait for its result before responding.\n- Escalate to a human agent only if the request falls outside these capabilities.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\nAll timestamps are stored in UTC (ISO 8601). Here are the main schemas and their relationships:\n\n- **Users**\n\n  - `user_id` (PK), `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `created_at`\n  - A customer profile.\n\n- **Accounts**\n\n  - `account_id` (PK), `user_id` → Users, `account_type` (checking|savings), `status` (open|closed|frozen), `opened_at`, `closed_at`\n  - A user may have 1–3 accounts.\n\n- **Transactions**\n\n  - `transaction_id` (PK), `account_id` → Accounts, `type` (deposit|withdrawal), `amount`, `currency`, `timestamp`, `related_id`\n  - All deposits, withdrawals, and refunds are subclasses of transactions.\n\n- **Deposits**\n\n  - `deposit_id` (PK), `transaction_id` → Transactions, `source` (branch|mobile|online|ATM), `received_at`\n\n- **Withdrawals**\n\n  - `withdrawal_id` (PK), `transaction_id` → Transactions, `method` (ATM|teller|online), `processed_at`\n\n- **Refunds**\n\n  - `refund_id` (PK), `transaction_id` → Transactions, `original_tx_id` → Transactions, `reason`, `processed_at`\n\n- **Loans**\n\n  - `loan_id` (PK), `user_id` → Users, `principal`, `interest_rate`, `issued_at`, `maturity_date`, `status` (active|paid_off|defaulted)\n\n- **Invoices**\n\n  - `invoice_id` (PK), `user_id` → Users, `amount_due`, `due_date`, `status` (issued|paid|overdue|cancelled), `issued_at`\n\n- **Authorizations**\n\n  - `auth_id` (PK), `account_id` → Accounts, `amount`, `currency`, `authorized_at`, `expires_at`, `status` (pending|captured|voided|expired)\n\n- **Assets**\n\n  - `asset_id` (PK), `user_id` → Users, `name`, `purchase_date`, `cost`, `useful_life_years`\n\n- **DepreciationEntries**\n\n  - `depreciation_id` (PK), `asset_id` → Assets, `period_start`, `period_end`, `amount`, `method` (straight_line|double_declining)\n\n- **AssetDisposals**\n\n  - `disposal_id` (PK), `asset_id` → Assets, `disposed_at`, `proceeds`\n\n- **AuditTrails**\n  - `audit_id` (PK), `entity` (User|Account|Transaction|Loan|Invoice), `entity_id`, `action` (create|update|delete), `performed_by` → Users, `performed_at`, `details`\n\n## Account Inquiry & Updates\n\n- **View account details**\n\n  - Confirm `user_id` and `account_id`. Then fetch account status, balances, opened/closed dates.\n\n- **Open a new account**\n\n  - Confirm `user_id`, account type (checking/savings).\n  - List terms and obtain “yes” before calling the open-account tool.\n\n- **Close an existing account**\n  - Confirm `account_id` belongs to the user and status = open.\n  - Confirm reason and obtain “yes” before calling the close-account tool.\n\n## Fund Transfers\n\n- Confirm `from_account_id`, `to_account_id`, and that both belong to the authenticated user.\n- Confirm available balance in the source account.\n- State amount, currency, and ask for explicit “yes.”\n- Then call the transfer tool.\n\n## Deposit & Withdrawal History\n\n- Confirm `account_id`.\n- Fetch recent `Deposits` and `Withdrawals` with timestamps and sources/methods.\n\n## Loan Services\n\n- **View loans**\n\n  - Confirm `user_id`, then list all loans with principal, rate, issued date, maturity, status.\n\n- **Apply for a loan**\n\n  - Confirm `user_id`, desired principal and term.\n  - List repayment schedule and interest rate.\n  - Obtain “yes,” then call the loan-origination tool.\n\n- **Pay off a loan**\n  - Confirm `loan_id` is active.\n  - Confirm payoff amount and payment `account_id`.\n  - Obtain “yes,” then call the loan-payoff tool.\n\n## Invoices & Payments\n\n- **List invoices**\n\n  - Confirm `user_id`, then retrieve invoices with amount, due date, status.\n\n- **Record payment**\n  - Confirm `invoice_id`, payment method, and amount.\n  - Obtain “yes,” then call the invoice-payment tool.\n\n## Refunds\n\n- Confirm `transaction_id` is eligible (must be a deposit or payment).\n- Confirm refund amount, `original_tx_id`, and reason.\n- Obtain “yes,” then call the refund tool.\n\n## Asset Management\n\n- **View assets**\n\n  - Confirm `user_id`, list assets with purchase date, cost, life.\n\n- **Depreciation schedule**\n\n  - Confirm `asset_id`, then show `DepreciationEntries` for each year.\n\n- **Dispose of an asset**\n  - Confirm `asset_id`, disposal date, proceeds.\n  - Obtain “yes,” then call the asset-disposal tool.\n\n## Audit-Trail Lookup\n\n- Confirm `user_id` or specific `entity`+`entity_id`.\n- Retrieve up to the last 30 entries from `AuditTrails`, showing who performed which action and when.\n"

Enroll in Online and Mobile Banking  \n   - You can view balances, transfer funds between your accounts, pay bills, and download statements instantly via our website or mobile app.  \n   - If you haven’t already, make sure you’ve set up multifactor authentication (MFA) for extra security.\n\n2. Set Up a Travel Notification  \n   - To prevent any fraud blocks on your debit or credit cards, it’s best to let us know the dates and countries you’ll be visiting.  \n   - You can add a travel notice in Online Banking under “Card Services,” or I can do it for you now—just let me know your travel dates and destinations.\n\n3. Minimize Foreign Transaction Fees  \n   - Our standard debit-card foreign‐transaction fee is 1.5% per transaction. If you expect to make frequent ATM withdrawals or card purchases abroad, you might consider:  \n     • Converting funds to a multi-currency checking account (we offer USD, EUR, GBP, and more).  \n     • Using partner ATMs to avoid additional surcharges.  \n\n4. International Wire Transfers  \n   - If you need to send or receive wire transfers, you can start the request in Online Banking. Let me know if you’d like the SWIFT/BIC details for your account.\n\n5. Customer Support and Security  \n   - You can chat 24/7 in the app or call our global toll-free line while overseas.  \n   - Always use secure networks (avoid public Wi-Fi) and update your app to the latest version.\n\nPlease let me know if you’d like me to set a travel notification now, discuss multi-currency options, or answer any other questions about abroad access.",

               "content":"Managing your accounts remotely from another country is straightforward with the right setup. Here are some best practices and tips to ensure you can bank seamlessly once you relocate:\n\n1. Online & Mobile Banking  \n   • Make sure you’ve enrolled in our online banking portal and downloaded the mobile app before you leave.  \n   • Enable push notifications or SMS alerts for transactions, low-balance warnings, and login attempts.  \n   • Set up biometric (fingerprint/face) login on your phone for faster, secure access.\n\n2. Multifactor Authentication (MFA)  \n   • Confirm your primary phone number or email is up-to-date so you can receive one-time passcodes.  \n   • If you’ll have a new phone number abroad, consider adding an alternate MFA method (authenticator app).\n\n3. Update Your Profile  \n   • Once you have your new address abroad, let us know so that statements, tax forms, and regulatory notices are sent to the correct place.  \n   • Adjust your time-zone preference in your profile so transaction timestamps and scheduled payments reflect your local time.\n\n4. International Transactions & Fees  \n   • Review our fee schedule for foreign-ATM withdrawals or currency-conversion fees. You may also want to order an ATM card that reimburses global ATM fees.  \n   • If you’ll be receiving/payments in local currency, you can set up a linked savings account in USD or open a multi-currency account if available.\n\n5. Wire Transfers & Currency Exchange  \n   • For large international transfers, consider using our online wire-transfer service. We typically offer better exchange rates and lower fees than in-branch wires.  \n   • Lock in favorable rates with a forward-contract service (if your business needs predictable budgeting).\n\n6. Recurring Payments & Bills  \n   • Review any standing orders (rent, utilities, subscriptions) and make sure they’re drawn from an account that’s always funded and accessible online.  \n   • If possible, switch to autopay on your credit cards and loan payments to avoid missed payments due to date differences.\n\n7. Customer Support Access  \n   • Save our international customer-service lines and live-chat links. We offer 24×7 support for online banking issues.  \n   • For complex needs (large transfers, account inquiries), open a secure message via the portal—this keeps everything in your encrypted inbox.\n\n8. Security Precautions  \n   • Avoid banking over public Wi-Fi. If you must, use a reputable VPN.  \n   • Keep your device’s OS and banking app up to date to guard against vulnerabilities.\n\n9. Local Compliance & Tax Reporting  \n   • Depending on the country, you may need to report foreign-held bank accounts. Consult a tax advisor to ensure you remain compliant with local and U.S. regulations (e.g., FATCA, FBAR).\n\n10. Additional Services  \n   • If you’ll be gone long-term, ask about “international status” on your account to prevent geo-based fraud blocks.  \n   • Consider enrolling in our premium global-banking package (if offered), which may include higher withdrawal limits, waived foreign-transaction fees, and dedicated support.\n\nLet me know if you’d like to update your contact details, adjust your time zone, review fee schedules, or discuss opening a multi-currency account — I can guide you through any of those steps.",

Comply with all data-privacy and financial-regulation requirements.\n- Do not invent any facts or procedures not supplied by the user or returned by your tools.\n- You may make at most one tool call per turn; if you call a tool, wait for its result before responding.\n- Escalate to a human agent only if the request falls outside these capabilities.\n\n## Domain Basic\n\nAll timestamps are stored in UTC (ISO 8601).
