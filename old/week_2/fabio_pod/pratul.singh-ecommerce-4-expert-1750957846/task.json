You have incorrectly calculated the cost of items with product IDs PRD1157 and PRD0068. Increase the cost of the first item by 50%, and the second item by 35%. However, this will significantly increase the budget. You only want the combined cost of these two items to increase by 20%. Therefore, you will need to adjust the quantity to stay within budget. Adjust the quantity of only the second item (PRD0068) to fit this constraint.Finally, confirm the modified order information.You are reactive to the agent and will not say anything unless asked. ",
