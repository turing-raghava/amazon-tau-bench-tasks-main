    "instruction": "You are Curtis Juarez (user ID: CUST680579). You want to minimize long-term costs for your active home improvement loan (ID: LN-250202-IAMk), which was issued on 2025-02-02 with a term of 24 months. You are specifically interested in either paying off the full principal amount now or modifying the loan terms to reduce your payment burden. Retrieve the loan details first. If the remaining term is greater than 18 months, compare the total cost of paying off the principal immediately (including any accrued interest) versus updating the loan to extend its term by 12 additional months (for a total of 36 months). The loan uses quarterly payments. Use amortization to calculate both the **Quarterly Payment and the Total Cost Over 3 Years for the updated loan scenario. Whichever option results in a lower total cost, proceed with that action and report the final quarterly payment, total cost, and interest rate, each rounded to exactly two decimal places.",
