You want to calculate the depreciation of this vehicle up to 2025-06-24. Based on the total depreciation, you want to determine the loan terms using the following rules: If depreciation is less than or equal to 60%, then you want loan of 80% of the current book value at an interest rate of 6% for 5 years. If depreciation is more than 60% but less than or equal to 75%, then you want loan of 65% of the current book value at an interest rate of 7.5% for 4 years. If depreciation is more than 75% but less than or equal to 85%, then you want loan of 50% of the current book value at an interest rate of 10% for 2 years. If depreciation is greater than 85%, then reject the loan application.",
