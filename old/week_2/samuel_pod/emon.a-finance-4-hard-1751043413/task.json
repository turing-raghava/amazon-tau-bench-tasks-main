First, calculate the monthly payment and total interest over the full loan term using amortization. Then, determine if it would be cheaper overall to pay off the full principal now instead. If the total interest exceeds USD 250, proceed to refinance the loan by reducing the interest rate by 2.13 percentage points and keeping the term unchanged. Otherwise, pay off the loan in full. Round all numeric outputs to exactly two decimal places.",
