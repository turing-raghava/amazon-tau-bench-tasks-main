First, calculate the total depreciation for both assets between 2022-01-01 and 2025-06-30. If the total depreciation across both assets exceeds $6000 then you need a new emergency loan. First ask if you are eligable for emergency loan or not, if eligable apply for a new loan using that amount as the principal, with an interest rate of 1.5%, a 10-year term, and monthly payments. If the total depreciation is below or equal to that threshold, update the existing loan (LN-250529-gnoz) by reducing the term to 30 months and the interest rate to 5.0%. Confirm the final loan configuration at the end.",
