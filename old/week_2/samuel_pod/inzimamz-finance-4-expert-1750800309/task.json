You want to refinance one of these loans by reducing its interest rate by 4.3% and extending its term by 1.5 years. To decide which loan to refinance, you need to calculate the annual interest burden for each loan and choose the one with the higher burden. If both burdens are equal, you want to select the loan with the shorter remaining term based on today’s date and the loan’s maturity date. You also want to update the maturity date based on the new term.",
