You want to compare different loan scenarios to make an informed decision. First, calculate the monthly payments for a $32,000 car loan at 6.75% interest rate for 60 months. Then, calculate two alternative scenarios: one with you only borrow $28,000 for 48 months at 5.25% interest rate, and another with a longer term where you borrow the full $35,000 but extend it to 72 months at 7.5% interest rate. After calculating the payments, apply for the lowest monthly payment loan.",
