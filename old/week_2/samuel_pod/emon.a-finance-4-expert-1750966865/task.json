    "instruction": "You are user CUST996230. You noticed that your personal loan (ID: LN-241201-kFWZ) currently has a higher interest rate than what was originally agreed upon. You want to calculate a new interest rate by reducing the current rate by 20%. After this calculation, if the resulting interest rate is still above 5.00, instruct the assistant to update the loan terms using the calculated interest rate and increase the loan term by one year; if the resulting rate is 5.00 or less, then update the loan terms using the new interest rate and increase the loan term by two years. Once this update is complete, you want to refinance another loan, LN-250208-QiNw, using the original interest rate and term (before the update) from loan LN-241201-kFWZ. However, if LN-250208-QiNw is in a paid-off status, you want to apply for a new loan instead, using the same interest rate and term as mentioned above, and the principal amount should match that of the paid-off loan. Ensure that all fractional numbers, such as interest rates, are always shown with exactly two decimal places.",
