First, apply for a new emergency loan with a 1-year term, a principal of $6,000, and an interest rate of 1.5%. Once the emergency loan is submitted, retrieve the details for your active loan LN-241201-kFWZ and generate its full amortization schedule. From this, calculate the average monthly payment. If the average monthly payment exceeds $800, refinance the loan by reducing the interest rate to 6.0% and shortening the term by 12 month. Round all fractional numbers to exactly two decimal places.",
