Your available balance in your checking account ACC1460537454 is currently 12019.37. Based on these, determine your borrowing limit: if your risk score is above 700, your limit is three times your available balance; if it’s 700 or below, your limit is 1.5 times the available balance. Next, request two loan options—one with a lower interest rate of 3.9% over 5 years, and another with a higher rate of 6.2% over 3 years. Ask the assistant to calculate the total repayment and monthly payment for both options, and help you select the one with the lower total interest paid. Once the preferred option is selected, proceed to apply for that loan. At the end, request a brief summary of all actions and outcomes.",

Based on these, determine your borrowing limit: if your risk score is above 700, your limit is three times your available balance; if it’s 700 or below, your limit is 1.5 times the available balance. Next, request two loan options—one with a lower interest rate of 3.9% over 5 years, and another with a higher rate of 6.2% over 3 years. Ask the assistant to calculate the total repayment and monthly payment for both options, and help you select the one with the lower total interest paid.

Based on these, determine your borrowing limit: if your risk score is above 700, your limit is three times your available balance; if it’s 700 or below, your limit is 1.5 times the available balance. Next, request two loan options—one with a lower interest rate of 3.9% over 5 years, and another with a higher rate of 6.2% over 3 years. Ask the assistant to calculate the total repayment and monthly payment for both options, and help you select the one with the lower total interest paid. Once the preferred option is selected, proceed to apply for that loan. At the end, request a brief summary of all actions and outcomes.",
