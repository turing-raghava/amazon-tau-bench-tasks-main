Due to some financial changes, you need to reduce your monthly payment to be under $700. You want to explore extending your loan term while keeping the same interest rate. First, calculate your current monthly payment. Then, calculate what your monthly payment would be if you extend the term to 72 months. If the 72-month payment is still above $700, calculate for 96 months. Once you find a term that brings the payment under $700, update your loan terms to that new duration. Finally, get the new amortization schedule to confirm the reduced payments.",
