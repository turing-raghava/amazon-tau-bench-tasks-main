It was purchased on 2024-10-01 for $47,033.66 and was disposed on 2024-10-28 due to damage. The recorded book value at disposal was $43,129.37. You want to repurchase the asset by contributing the depreciated value till the date of damage using a loan, and the remaining amount will be financed by the insurance company. Calculate the total depreciation between the purchase and disposal dates. If the calculated book value differs from the recorded book value, use the lesser of the two to determine the depreciated loss. If the depreciated loss is greater than $1,000, apply for a 2 year loan at 9.75% interest. If it is $1,000 or less, apply for a 1 year loan at 11%. The loan amount should match the depreciated loss.",
