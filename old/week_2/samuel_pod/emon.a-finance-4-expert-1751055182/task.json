You previously owned two assets: Software Generation 314 (Asset ID: SFT-SEA-3617), purchased on 2021-10-25, and Machinery Growth 143 (Asset ID: MAC-SEA-9726), purchased on 2021-07-19. Calculate the total depreciation for each asset from its respective purchase date up to 2025-06-01. Then compute the total interest paid over its term for loan LN-250302-gEOW using the calulate amortization tool. If the combined total depreciation of the two assets exceeds the total interest paid on the loan, apply for a new loan with a principal equal to the combined depreciation amount, same term as the loan LN-250302-gEOW and the interest reate should be twenty percentage less from loan LN-250302-gEOW. Finally, report the depreciation total and confirm whether the new loan was applied, rounding the values to exactly two decimal places.",
