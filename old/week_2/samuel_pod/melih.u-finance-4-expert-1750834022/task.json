Due to lower market rates, you want to explore refinancing options to reduce your monthly payments. First, calculate your current monthly payment. Then, explore refinancing the remaining balance with two options: a 48-month term at 6.75% interest rate or keeping the same 60-month term but at 7.25% interest rate. After reviewing the payment differences, you decide to refinance with the lowest monthly payment. Proceed with refinancing, and once the refinancing is complete, calculate your monthly savings with the new payment.",
