You have a software asset (ID: SFT-DAL-9790) currently active in your portfolio where cost is 8176.7 and current book value is 7906.4. Begin by checking the depreciation value of the asset from its purchase date (2025-01-21) up to 2027-12-31. Then subtract the deprication vaue from the assistant cost to calculate CAD value. If the CAD value after depreciation is still above 85% of the original cost, you want to apply for a new loan where the principal is 90% of the asset's current book value, with 1.2% interest over 5 years. However, if the the CAD value is less than 85% of the original cost, then you want to refinance your defaulted loan instead. For refinancing, reduce the original interest rate by fifteen percentage and increase the loan term to 36 months. Ensure that all fractional numbers are always shown with exactly two decimal places.",

Begin by checking the depreciation value of the asset from its purchase date (2025-01-21) up to 2027-12-31. Then subtract the deprication vaue from the assistant cost to calculate CAD value. If the CAD value after depreciation is still above 85% of the original cost, you want to apply for a new loan where the principal is 90% of the asset's current book value, with 1.2% interest over 5 years. However, if the the CAD value is less than 85% of the original cost, then you want to refinance your defaulted loan instead. For refinancing, reduce the original interest rate by fifteen percentage and increase the loan term to 36 months.

Begin by checking the depreciation value of the asset from its purchase date (2025-01-21) up to 2027-12-31. Then subtract the deprication vaue from the assistant cost to calculate CAD value. If the CAD value after depreciation is still above 85% of the original cost, you want to apply for a new loan where the principal is 90% of the asset's current book value, with 1.2% interest over 5 years. However, if the the CAD value is less than 85% of the original cost, then you want to refinance your defaulted loan instead. For refinancing, reduce the original interest rate by fifteen percentage and increase the loan term to 36 months.

          "content": "Here are some steps and considerations for refinancing a defaulted education loan:\n\n1. Review Your Current Loan Status  \n   • Obtain your loan details (loan ID, outstanding balance, interest rate, default date).  \n   • Check your credit report to see how the default has impacted your score.\n\n2. Explore Federal Loan Rehabilitation or Consolidation (if it’s a federal loan)  \n   • Rehabilitation: You make 9 voluntary, reasonable payments over 10 consecutive months to remove the default status.  \n   • Direct Consolidation Loan: You combine one or more federal loans into a new loan; may require entering repayment on the new loan before you can refinance privately.\n\n3. Consider Private Refinancing Options  \n   • Shop around for private lenders that will refinance a rehabilitated or consolidated loan.  \n   • Compare interest rates, fees, and terms (fixed vs. variable, repayment period).  \n   • Check eligibility criteria—many lenders require a good credit score or a creditworthy co-signer.\n\n4. Gather Documentation  \n   • Proof of income (pay stubs, W-2s or 1099s).  \n   • Loan payoff statements from your current servicer.  \n   • Identification (driver’s license, passport).  \n   • Recent credit report.\n\n5. Pre-qualify and Rate Shop  \n   • Many lenders offer a soft credit pull to show you potential rates with no score impact.  \n   • Get quotes from multiple lenders to find the lowest rate and best terms.\n\n6. Submit the Refinance Application  \n   • Fill out the lender’s application, upload documents, and authorize a hard credit pull.  \n   • Review and sign the new loan agreement.  \n   • The new lender pays off your old loan, and you begin payments on the refinanced loan.\n\n7. Post-Refinance Checklist  \n   • Verify payoff of the original loan and update your account status.  \n   • Set up autopay or reminders to avoid missed payments.  \n   • Keep an eye on your credit report to confirm the new loan appears correctly.\n\nIf you’d like to move forward with refinancing through our platform, please let me know the specific loan ID and the rate/term you’re targeting. I can then walk you through the exact steps here or initiate the refinance tool once you confirm.",
