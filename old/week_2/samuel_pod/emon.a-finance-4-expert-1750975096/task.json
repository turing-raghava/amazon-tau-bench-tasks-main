    "instruction": "You are user CUST893584. You are trying to resolve an issue with your defaulted education loan (ID: LN-250124-qnTD). You have a software asset (ID: SFT-DAL-9790) currently active in your portfolio where cost is 8176.7 and current book value is 7906.4. Begin by checking the depreciation value of the asset from its purchase date (2025-01-21) up to 2027-12-31. Then subtract the deprication vaue from the assistant cost to calculate CAD value. If the CAD value after depreciation is still above 85% of the original cost, you want to apply for a new loan where the principal is 90% of the asset's current book value, with 1.2% interest over 5 years. However, if the the CAD value is less than 85% of the original cost, then you want to refinance your defaulted loan instead. For refinancing, reduce the original interest rate by fifteen percentage and increase the loan term to 36 months. Ensure that all fractional numbers are always shown with exactly two decimal places.",
