First get the loan details, then determine which of these loans has a shorter remaining term based on their maturity dates. If the shorter-term loan has an interest rate above 4%, update its term to be more 3 years shorter and reduce its interest rate by 60 percent. Then, if the longer-term loan has an outstanding balance below $10,000, close it. After performing these updates, apply for a new loan with a 5-year term, a principal equal to the combined principal amount of the previous two loans, and an interest rate equal to the average of the original interest rates (before updating terms) minus 0.5 points. Round all fractional outputs to exactly two decimal places.",
