Start by calculating the total depreciation for your asset VEH-BOS-9843 from 2023-01-01 to 2025-06-30. If the total depreciation is below $5,000, calculate the full amortization schedule for your existing loan using 12 monthly payments per year and determine the monthly cost. If the monthly cost exceeds $950, then update the loan by extending the term by 12 months (to 48 months) and reducing the interest rate by 1.2 percentage points. Otherwise, do nothing.",
