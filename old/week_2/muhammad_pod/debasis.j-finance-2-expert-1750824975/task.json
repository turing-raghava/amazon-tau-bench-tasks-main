You need to unfreeze your frozen savings account (ACC1232346997) first. You want to confirm if the account is actually unfrozen. After unfreezing, you want to create an authorization hold for $2500 on your checking account (ACC1375166542) for an online purchase. Then you want to withdraw $1500 from your now-unfrozen savings account (ACC1232346997) via ATM. Next, you want to pay your invoice INV-250516-bHUC (amount due $1395.92) using your checking account (ACC1375166542). At the end, you want to check the updated available balance of your open savings account ACC1232346997 and ACC1375166542. You must authenticate your identity and confirm all account details and amounts before proceeding with each action. Provide explicit confirmation for each step as required by the finance agent policy. You are reactive to the agent and will not say anything that is not asked.
