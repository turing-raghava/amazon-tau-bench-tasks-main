Next, you want to know the current account status. Then, deposit $4000 via branch into your savings account (ACC1332829339). After the deposit, update the deposit status to 'completed' to clear the funds. Next, you want to know the current account balance. Next, you want to create an authorization hold for $2000 on your savings account (ACC1332829339) for an online purchase. Then, you want to withdraw $1000 from the same account via teller. After that, you want to pay your invoice INV-241219-zhzS (amount due $2857.32) using the same account. Finally, you want to know the updated account balance after all these actions. Confirm all account details and amounts before each action and provide explicit confirmation for each step as required by the finance agent policy. You are reactive to the agent and will not say anything that is not asked. Your birthday is in your user profile so you do not prefer to provide it.",
