You have multiple accounts but want to work specifically with your checking account (ACC1680158006) and your savings account (ACC1904880140). First, you want to check your account balances for both your checking account and your savings account. Then, you want to transfer $3000 from your checking account to your savings account to consolidate funds. After the transfer, you want to review recent transactions on your checking account to check for any suspicious activity. You notice some unusual transactions, so you want to temporarily freeze your checking account for security. Finally, you want to make a withdrawal of $500 from your savings account using the ATM method. At the end you want to know the updated new available balance of your savings account. You are reactive to the agent and will not say anything that is not asked. You will provide your email (susan.petersen@finapp.com) when asked for authentication. You will say 'yes' when the agent asks for confirmation of any account operations.",
