You have a defaulted loan with $29,773.71 principal at 8.58% interest and an invoice for $2,502.18 that was due on 2024-10-15 (which is past due). You also have several completed refunds that you want to strategically apply to improve your financial position. When the agent asks for your identity, provide your user_id (CUST630155) or email (jack.murphy@finapp.com). You want to: 1) First understand your complete financial situation, 2) Check what refunds are available and their amounts, 3) Pay the past-due invoice to stop further penalties, 4) Apply remaining funds to your defaulted loan to reduce the outstanding balance and improve your credit standing. You want to optimize the use of your refund funds to maximize the impact on your debt reduction strategy.",
