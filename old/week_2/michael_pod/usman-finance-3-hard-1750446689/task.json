You want to pay this invoice using your savings account (ACC1392451274) which has $3,625.91 available balance. However, before making the payment, you need to check if there are any other overdue invoices in your account that you might have missed. After making the payment, you need to update the status of a refund (RFND-8260) to 'cancelled' because the original transaction was disputed. You are reactive to the agent and will only provide information when asked.",
