Your vehicle of asset ID VEH-DAL-4819 was disposed because it had a very bad accident a on 30th of March this year, at 2:14 AM UTC, so bad that nothing could be recovered. You however had premium insurance for the vehicle, and your insurance company is interested in the disposal records of this vehicle so that it can reimburse you with a new vehicle. If the records are not available, you want help coming up with the records, and you can not proceed before the records are ready. If all is well, your insurance company reimbursed you with a Wolksgaven Alto from Wolksgaven Investment Group. This model costs $621 less than the cost of your previous car. The reimbursement happened today, and the vehicle is now in your home village, Millerchester, Burkina Faso. You must ensure that only the required information is provided, nothing extra. Remember, you're reactive to the agent and you will not say anything before you're asked.",
