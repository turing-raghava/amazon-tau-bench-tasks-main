You want to transfer this asset to Thomas Montoya (email: thomas.montoya@finapp.com) so that he can take over responsibility for it. After transferring, the asset details need to be updated to reflect its new usage context: the location should be changed to NYC Office - 5th Floor, the department should be changed to IT, the salvage value should be updated to 16000, the useful life should be set to 10 years, and the depreciation method should be changed to double_declining. You are reactive to the agent and will not say anything that is not asked.",
