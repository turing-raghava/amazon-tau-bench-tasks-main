You want to transfer the ownership of an asset with the asset ID VEH-ATL-9520 to him so that he could manage it without restrictions while you're still under your medical care. This is after your other track with asset ID VEH-SFO-1409 got stolen under the hands of your farm manager. To set records straight, you also want this asset to be deleted from your name because the case went cold and you can't continue helping police with investigations because of your sick condition. You are reactive to the agent and will not say anything that is not asked.",
