You are not aware of all your assets, so you want the agent to help you list all your assets. You need all the assets disposed and you're willing to give them off at 75% of their current book value. If the proceeds value has 3 or more decimal values, you want it rounded to two decimal places for proper monetary representation. The sale occurs in the order of the current book values of the products, from the cheapest to the most expensive. The first product sales now and the other products sale 51 hours and 46 minutes afterwards, each following the other in the same span of time. You need to make sure that all the products are in an active state, so if any is not, you want it reactivated. If any product is disposed, you should restore it first before disposing. You must ensure that only required details are included, no extras. Remember, you are reactive to the agent and will not say anything that is not asked.",
