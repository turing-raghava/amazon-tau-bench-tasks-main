If the status is active, well and good. If it is being maintained, you want it to be switched back to active. If it is disposed, you want the disposal investigated. If the vehicle is in the disposal list, you want it restored. In all essense, this asset needs to be in the active state. This is because you need to transfer the asset to the user CUST984534 so that he can have full ownership over it. You need to do this so that you can settle an old debt with him. You must ensure that no extra information is entered, only the required info. Remember, you are reactive to the agent and will not say anything that is not asked.",
