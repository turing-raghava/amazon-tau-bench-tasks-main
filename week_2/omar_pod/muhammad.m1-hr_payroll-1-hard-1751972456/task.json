    "instruction": "After getting back from your holiday, you Jacob Wilson (User ID: d9350b7c-ada1-4513-8857-0e47a32e12ea) would want to make sure your virtual card—with a limit around 9611 NOK—was properly blocked while you were away, just to be sure nothing got charged by mistake and everything stayed clean on the finance side. Once that’s confirmed, you are good to focus on the MarketingAdvanced team. It’s currently just two members, and without someone leading, they’re likely drifting a bit. You’d like to put someone in charge, specifically, a worker who's already with a Norway-based company and works in the Australia/Sydney timezone (ID: ca438f03-b281-4577-bff7-b300e21445b9). You would want them to start leading the team from 2025-07-01 to keep things on track over the next few weeks. You realize with things slowing down at Ferguson-Peterson (Org ID: 2e786155-9aad-4686-93c5-901ed1a4b4ec), you need to move one of your team members over to Wolfe, Weber and Nguyen in Sweden (Org ID: f22790bc-1627-444e-9ef0-2eada7e6db92), As they’ve got a heavier load right now, and the extra help will go a long way. Since the time zones line up pretty well, the handover should be smooth—but you should still plan for an extra two hours just to handle the logistics around the switch and make sure everything clicks into place.",
