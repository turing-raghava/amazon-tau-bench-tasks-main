Your organization needs to set up automated invoice processing for external consultancy services. Review all active workers in the organization to understand the current workforce structure and identify who will be involved in the vendor payment approval process. Examine the organization's payroll runs to analyze payment patterns and establish baseline financial data for the new vendor system. Check all user-organization working relationships to verify James Johnson's authorization levels for vendor payment processing. Review the current invoice status across the organization to understand existing payment workflows and identify any pending vendor payments. Create a new specialized financial provider called 'VendorPay Solutions' based in Canada that supports CAD and USD currencies to handle the new automated vendor payment system. Generate a priority vendor services invoice for $2800 CAD due on 2025-07-25 for the initial system setup and integration services provided by external consultants. Mark this setup invoice as paid to demonstrate the new payment system is operational and complete the vendor payment system deployment.",
