You want to begin by retrieving his user profile along with associated worker details. Then, you’d like to verify whether Troy has an active contract. If he does, you want to update his bank account CXPN82510868096761 to use the same currency as his contract. Next, you’d like to check if he has already been assigned to any internal teams. If no team assignment is found, you want to issue a reimbursement using the same amount as his active contract, with the reason “Compensation for delayed team onboarding.",
