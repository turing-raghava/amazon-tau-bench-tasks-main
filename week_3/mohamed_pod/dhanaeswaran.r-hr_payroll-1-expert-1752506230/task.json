One of the current team leads from the 'EngineeringAlpha' team, identified by user ID '3ba37ced-9063-4447-bdbe-f650b5981f88', has submitted her resignation and is preparing to leave the organization. You would like to begin the offboarding process by first removing her from the team and then deactivating her user account once her responsibilities have been fully transitioned. To support the transition, the organization has recently hired two new employees. One of them is an experienced professional who has been selected to take over the lead responsibilities for the 'EngineeringAlpha' team. He has already been assigned the user ID 'c528214a-f617-4ef3-bea5-7f6da9d91ba9', and you would like to proceed with creating a new worker profile to onboard him into the organization. He is scheduled to join as the new team lead on '2025-07-03'. The second hire is a fresher named 'Ava Holloway', who is just beginning her professional journey. She has enrolled using the email address 'ava.holloway@example.com', and her working timezone is set to 'Australia/Sydney'. You would like to create a new user profile for Ava, onboard her into the organization, and ensure she is prepared to begin contributing effectively to her assigned role.",
