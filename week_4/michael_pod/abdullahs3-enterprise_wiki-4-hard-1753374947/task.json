While reading through the page titled 'Troubleshooting Guide' (created by user 280), you decide to leave a comment: 'Let us also include a KPI alignment section here.' To make it easier to tag content related to team performance and goal tracking, you create a label called 'execution-metrics' with the description 'Pages referencing KPIs and execution tracking'. You assign the label to the same page and increment its usage count. A little later, you realize the tag might cause overlap with existing OKR content, so you remove the label to keep things clean.",
