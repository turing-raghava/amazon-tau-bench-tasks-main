Brian Wright, a key employee with user ID '584ff1c5-b542-4902-a541-13ab75b948a3', is departing the company, and I need to complete his financial offboarding. My first priority is to confirm that he is still active in the organizationâ€”if he is not, I will halt the process. If he is, my goal is to ensure that all financial matters are resolved before terminating his contract. This includes compensating him for the final 63 hours he worked, based on his hourly rate, by issuing an invoice with a due date of July 5th, 2025. I also need to process his last expense reimbursement of 350 for final travel expenses. These are the only outstanding financial matters related to Brian, and once they are resolved, I will proceed with terminating his contract.",
