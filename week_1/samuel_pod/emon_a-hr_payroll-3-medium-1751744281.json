Begin by listing all active workers in the organization and identify those whose worker type is 'contractor', collecting all relevant information about them. For each contractor, retrieve their current contracts and select the most recent one based on start date. To assess eligibility for virtual cards or reimbursements, check whether the worker is assigned to any team. If the worker is assigned to a team but has no current contract, issue a virtual card using USD currency, a limit of 4000, and provider ID 13d401e9-190d-424b-8ec1-0b39e6c422ce. For contractors who are not assigned to any team and also lack any current contract, process a reimbursement of 2000 with the reason 'No team assignment or contract at time of review'. Finally, retrieve the organizationâ€™s total invoice status to ensure the reimbursement aligns with overall expense trends.",
