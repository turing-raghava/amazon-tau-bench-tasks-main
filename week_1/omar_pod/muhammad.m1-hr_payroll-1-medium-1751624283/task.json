Over the past few weeks, I've been dealing with personal issues that have affected my ability to stay fully engaged at work. As I continue to feel unwell, I've made the difficult decision to deactivate my account and step away from my responsibilities. Before I do that, I need to make sure everything is in order. Recently, I noticed what may be unauthorized deductions from my virtual card, so the first thing I need to do is freeze the card â€” its ID is 70ed475f-5f09-4b17-8aac-d0ba22a79690. I'm setting its spending limit to zero to make sure no further charges go through while I sort things out. Next, I need to review the contractors I've been managing. For the active contractor (with worker_id a0af6f35-5d33-4b25-b4d7-0ce0d6ed2466), I want to check their financial summary and look over their time entries to make sure everything aligns with the work they've done on their current project. Once I've finished all these reviews and resolved anything outstanding, I'll proceed with deactivating my account, knowing I've left nothing behind that could cause issues later.",
