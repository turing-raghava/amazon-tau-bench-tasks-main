# Incident Management Policy
Current Date: September 02, 2025

## Introduction
This document defines the operational guide for an incident management automation agent.  
It is designed for single-turn execution: each procedure must be self-contained and completed in one interaction.

## SOPs
These Standard Operating Procedures provide structured workflows for managing incidents.  
Each procedure defines clear steps, role-based permissions, and validation requirements to ensure consistent incident handling and resolution.

## Incident Operations

### Creating Incidents
When to use: When service impacts are detected requiring formal incident management response.  
Who can perform: Incident managers, technical support, and system administrators, 3rd party vendors (vendor_contact), executive  
Pre-checks:
- Check that reporter user exists and has active status
- Verify client exists
- Check that component exists if specified

Steps:
- Collect incident title, category, severity, and impact level
- Set detection timestamp
- Associate with specified client and infrastructure component records
- Create incident record and return incident identifier

#### Severity Classification Process during Incident Creation:  
Evaluate the following conditions and set the corresponding boolean flags (`p1_*`, `p2_*`, `p3_*`) to **True** for every condition that applies based on the available data. Compute severity as **P1** if any P1 condition is `True`; otherwise **P2** if any P2 condition is `True`; otherwise **P3** if any P3 condition is `True`; otherwise **P4**.

**P1 Evaluation:**
- Evaluate whether the incident causes complete outage of business-critical service with no workaround available.
- Evaluate whether the incident impacts the entire enterprise or multiple customers with 5 or more affected parties.
- Evaluate whether the incident has significant regulatory, safety, or financial implications.
- Evaluate whether the incident involves a high-priority customer with contractual P1 requirements or is a recurrent incident.

**P2 Evaluation:**
- Evaluate whether the incident causes major degradation of business-critical services with a workaround available.
- Evaluate whether the incident impacts multiple departments, sites, or critical business functions.
- Evaluate whether the incident risks breaching a high-priority SLA with significant impact.

**P3 Evaluation:**
- Evaluate whether the incident impacts a single department, localized users, or a non-critical function.
- Evaluate whether the incident causes moderate degradation with operations continuing using a minimal workaround.

If none of the P1/P2/P3 conditions apply, set severity as **P4**.

- Set detection timestamp and initial status as open  
- Associate with specified client and reporter.  
- Create incident record with determined severity level and return incident identifier

### Updating Incident Status
When to use: When incident conditions change requiring status modifications or progress updates.  
Who can perform: Incident managers, technical support, executive  
Pre-checks:
- Verify incident exists and is accessible to user
- Check user's role allows incident modifications

Steps:
- Retrieve current incident record
- Collect specific status changes or field updates needed
- Check that new status value matches allowed enum values (if there is any)
- Create incident update record(s) documenting the change(s) along with logging the user who conducted the change
- Apply changes to incident with the user identifier
- Return updated incident information

#### subscription tier values and metrics
**Premium Tier**
Target clients: Enterprise customers with mission-critical operations
Response times by severity:
- P1 (Critical): 15-30 minutes initial response
- P2 (High): 1-2 hours initial response
- P3 (Medium): 4-8 hours initial response
- P4 (Low): 24-48 hours initial response

Resolution times:
- P1: 2-4 hours resolution target
- P2: 8-24 hours resolution target
- P3: 48-72 hours resolution target
- P4: 128 hours resolution target
Availability guarantee: 99.9% uptime
Support coverage: 24/7/365

**Standard Tier**
Target clients: Mid-market businesses with important but less critical operations
Response times by severity:
- P1: 1-2 hours initial response
- P2: 4-8 hours initial response
- P3: 24 hours initial response
- P4: 48-72 hours initial response

Resolution times:
- P1: 8-24 hours resolution target
- P2: 24-48 hours resolution target
- P3: 72-120 hours resolution target
- P4: 168 hours resolution target
Availability guarantee: 99.5% uptime
Support coverage: Business hours with on-call for critical issues

**Basic Tier**

Target clients: Small businesses and startups with standard operational needs
Response times by severity:
- P1: 4-8 hours initial response
- P2: 24 hours initial response
- P3: 48-72 hours initial response
- P4: 5-7 business days initial response

Resolution times:
- P1: 24-48 hours resolution target
- P2: 72-120 hours resolution target
- P3: 5-10 business days resolution target
- P4: 2 weeks

Availability guarantee: 99.0% uptime
Support coverage: Business hours only

**SLA Breach Detection and Logging:**
When marking an incident as resolved, the system should automatically check if the total resolution time exceeded the SLA targets defined for the customer's subscription tier and incident severity level. If the actual resolution time was longer than the guaranteed resolution target, this constitutes an SLA breach that must be recorded and logged for tracking and reporting purposes.

## Product and Infrastructure Operations

### Creating Product Records
When to use: When adding new systems or applications requiring incident management coverage.  
Who can perform: Technical support, system administrators  
Pre-checks:
- Check that product name is unique
- Verify all required fields are provided
- Confirm vendor exists if vendor support is specified

Steps:
- Acquire product information including name, type, and version
- Check for existing products with same name
- Link to vendor record if external support required
- Create product record and return product identifier

### Managing Infrastructure Components
When to use: When documenting system components that support products and services.  
Who can perform: Technical support, system administrators.  
Pre-checks:
- Verify product exists if component is associated with a product
- Check that component name is unique within the specified product

Steps:
- Acquire component details including name, type, environment, and staus
- Check for existing components with same name under same product
- Set operational status based on user input
- Record port numbers if provided
- Create component record linked to product

## Subscription and Service Level Management

### Creating Client Subscriptions
When to use: When establishing service agreements and coverage levels for clients.  
Who can perform: Account managers, incident manager, executive  
Pre-checks:
- Verify client record exists
- Check product record exists 

Steps:
- Collect subscription details including type, service level tier, and dates
- Set recovery time objectives based on user input
- Define start and end dates as specified
- Link subscription to specified client and product records
- Create subscription record with active status

### Creating SLA agreement
Who can perform: Account managers, system administrators, executives
Pre-checks:
- Verify subscription exists and is active
- Check user has authority to create SLA agreements for this client
- Validate response/resolution times align with subscription tier

Use case: When defining specific SLA metrics for client subscriptions



### Managing Service Level Agreements
When to use: When defining response and resolution requirements for different incident severities.  
Who can perform: Account managers, incident managers, and executives.  
Pre-checks:
- Verify subscription record exists
- Check that severity level exists in allowed enumeration

Steps:
- Collect service level parameters for specified severity level
- Set response time requirements in minutes as specified
- Define resolution time objectives in hours as specified
- Set availability percentage targets if provided
- Create SLA record linked to subscription
  

## Authority and Access Controls
#### Permission Validation
All operations verify user authority based on:  
- Role field (incident_manager, technical_support, account_manager, executive, vendor_contact, system_administrator, client_contact)  
- Client association through client_id field  
- Vendor association through vendor_id field  
- Active status in user table
