# Incident Management Policy
Current Date: September 02, 2025

## Introduction
This document defines the operational guide for an incident management automation agent.  
It is designed for single-turn execution: each procedure must be self-contained and completed in one interaction.

## SOPs
These Standard Operating Procedures provide structured workflows for managing incidents.  
Each procedure defines clear steps, role-based permissions, and validation requirements to ensure consistent incident handling and resolution.

## Incident Operations

### Creating Incidents
When to use: When service impacts are detected requiring formal incident management response.  
Who can perform: Incident managers, technical support, and system administrators, 3rd party vendors (vendor_contact), executive  
Pre-checks:
- Check that reporter user exists and has active status
- Verify client exists
- Check that component exists if specified

Steps:
- Collect incident title, category, severity, and impact level
- Set detection timestamp
- Associate with specified client and infrastructure component records
- Create incident record and return incident identifier

#### Severity Classification Process during Incident Creation:  
Evaluate the following conditions and set the corresponding boolean flags (`p1_*`, `p2_*`, `p3_*`) to **True** for every condition that applies based on the available data. Compute severity as **P1** if any P1 condition is `True`; otherwise **P2** if any P2 condition is `True`; otherwise **P3** if any P3 condition is `True`; otherwise **P4**.

**P1 Evaluation:**
- Evaluate whether the incident causes complete outage of business-critical service with no workaround available.
- Evaluate whether the incident impacts the entire enterprise or multiple customers with 5 or more affected parties.
- Evaluate whether the incident has significant regulatory, safety, or financial implications.
- Evaluate whether the incident involves a high-priority customer with contractual P1 requirements or is a recurrent incident.

**P2 Evaluation:**
- Evaluate whether the incident causes major degradation of business-critical services with a workaround available.
- Evaluate whether the incident impacts multiple departments, sites, or critical business functions.
- Evaluate whether the incident risks breaching a high-priority SLA with significant impact.

**P3 Evaluation:**
- Evaluate whether the incident impacts a single department, localized users, or a non-critical function.
- Evaluate whether the incident causes moderate degradation with operations continuing using a minimal workaround.

If none of the P1/P2/P3 conditions apply, set severity as **P4**.

- Set detection timestamp and initial status as open  
- Associate with specified client and reporter.  
- Create incident record with determined severity level and return incident identifier

### Updating Incident Status
When to use: When incident conditions change requiring status modifications or progress updates.  
Who can perform: Incident managers, technical support, executive  
Pre-checks:
- Verify incident exists and is accessible to user
- Check user's role allows incident modifications

Steps:
- Retrieve current incident record
- Collect specific status changes or field updates needed
- Check that new status value matches allowed enum values (if there is any)
- Create incident update record(s) documenting the change(s) along with logging the user who conducted the change
- Apply changes to incident with the user identifier
- Return updated incident information

#### subscription tier values and metrics
**Premium Tier**
Target clients: Enterprise customers with mission-critical operations
Response times by severity:
- P1 (Critical): 15-30 minutes initial response
- P2 (High): 1-2 hours initial response
- P3 (Medium): 4-8 hours initial response
- P4 (Low): 24-48 hours initial response

Resolution times:
- P1: 2-4 hours resolution target
- P2: 8-24 hours resolution target
- P3: 48-72 hours resolution target
- P4: 128 hours resolution target
Availability guarantee: 99.9% uptime
Support coverage: 24/7/365

**Standard Tier**
Target clients: Mid-market businesses with important but less critical operations
Response times by severity:
- P1: 1-2 hours initial response
- P2: 4-8 hours initial response
- P3: 24 hours initial response
- P4: 48-72 hours initial response

Resolution times:
- P1: 8-24 hours resolution target
- P2: 24-48 hours resolution target
- P3: 72-120 hours resolution target
- P4: 168 hours resolution target
Availability guarantee: 99.5% uptime
Support coverage: Business hours with on-call for critical issues

**Basic Tier**

Target clients: Small businesses and startups with standard operational needs
Response times by severity:
- P1: 4-8 hours initial response
- P2: 24 hours initial response
- P3: 48-72 hours initial response
- P4: 5-7 business days initial response

Resolution times:
- P1: 24-48 hours resolution target
- P2: 72-120 hours resolution target
- P3: 5-10 business days resolution target
- P4: 2 weeks

Availability guarantee: 99.0% uptime
Support coverage: Business hours only

**SLA Breach Detection and Logging:**
When marking an incident as resolved, the system should automatically check if the total resolution time exceeded the SLA targets defined for the customer's subscription tier and incident severity level. If the actual resolution time was longer than the guaranteed resolution target, this constitutes an SLA breach that must be recorded and logged for tracking and reporting purposes.

## Client Management Operations

### Creating Client Records
When to use: When registering new enterprise, mid-market, small business, or startup clients requiring incident management services.  
Who can perform: Account managers, system administrators  
Pre-checks:
- Verify client registration number is unique by checking existing client records
- Check that contact email is not already used by another client

Steps:
- Collect complete client information including name, registration number, contact details, and client type
- Check for existing records with same registration number or email
- Set initial status as active unless user specifies otherwise
- Create client record
- Return client identifier and successful creation flag if client was created 

### Updating Client Information
When to use: When client details change or status modifications are required.  
Who can perform: Account managers and system administrators  
Pre-checks:
- Verify client record exists
- Check user has permission to modify this client's information based on their role and client association
- Confirm new registration number or email is unique if being changed

Steps:
- Retrieve current client record
- Collect specific fields requiring updates
- Apply the changes requested
- Return successful creation flag if client information was updated

## User Management Operations

### Creating User Accounts
When to use: When adding personnel to the incident management system.  
Who can perform: System administrators and incident managers

- Check that email address is unique
- Verify all required fields are provided by user
- Confirm client or vendor exists if association is specified

Steps:
- Acquire complete user information including name, email, role, and department
- Check for existing records with same email address, users should have unique email
- Associate user with specified client or vendor if provided

- Create user record and return user identifier

### Managing User Permissions

Who can perform: System administrators and incident managers  
Pre-checks:
- Verify user record exists
- Check requesting user has authority based on role (system administrators, incident managers only)
- Confirm new role value exists in allowed enumeration

Steps:

## Vendor Management Operations

Who can perform: System administrators, incident managers, and executives.  
Pre-checks:
- Check that vendor name, contact phone and emails are unique
- Verify all required fields are provided
- Confirm vendor type exists in allowed enumeration values

Steps:
- Acquire vendor details including name, type, and contact information
- Check for existing records with same vendor name
- Set status as active unless user specifies otherwise

## Authority and Access Controls

### Permission Validation
All operations verify user authority based on:
- Role field (incident_manager, technical_support, account_manager, executive, vendor_contact, system_administrator, client_contact)
- Client association through client_id field
- Vendor association through vendor_id field
- Active status in user table
