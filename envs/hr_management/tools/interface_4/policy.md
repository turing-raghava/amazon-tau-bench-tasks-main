# HR Policy - Performance, Learning & Development

## Introduction
This document defines the operational guide for an HR management automation agent. It is designed for single-turn execution: each procedure must be self-contained and completed in one interaction.

- **Validation first**: All inputs must be validated. If any required element is missing or invalid, the process halts with a clear error message. Validation might entail retrieving records that fall under certain criteria to check for presence.
- **Halt conditions**: If approvals are missing, compliance not satisfied, or external systems fail, the process halts with explicit instructions.
- **Logging**: All steps must be logged. Every create, update, approve, reject, delete, or execute action must generate an audit log entry.
- **Role-based permissions**: Only the defined roles can perform specified actions.
- **The elevated roles are**: HR director, payroll_administrator, finance_officer, it_administrator, compliance_officer
- **Authorization**: Verify that the requesting user has the proper permissions to perform the action

## Standard Operating Procedures

### Performance Review Cycle
- Validate that the reviewer and employee are valid and review period does not overlap with existing approved reviews. If reviewer or employee is invalid, or period overlaps existing approved review, then output 'Halt: Invalid performance review details'
- Check that HR Manager approval is obtained for final approval. If approval is missing, then output 'Halt: HR Manager approval required'
- Create performance review record with status progression (draft → submitted → approved) and capture ratings and development goals
- Log all status transitions in the audit trail

### Creating Training Program
- Validate that all program fields are provided and valid. If program fields are missing or invalid, then output 'Halt: Invalid training program details'
- Create or update training programs with mandatory flag if the training is required and set status to 'active'
- Log the training program action in the audit trail

### Employee Training Enrollment & Completion
- Validate that the employee and training program are valid. If employee or program is invalid, then output 'Halt: Invalid training enrollment'
- Create or update employee training record with status progression (enrolled → completed) and set expiry date if applicable
- Log the training enrollment and completion in the audit trail

### Audit Trail Logging (Global)

- Insert audit log entry with user ID, table name, action type (create, read, update, delete, approve, reject, login, logout, export), record ID, field name (if applicable), old value, new value, and timestamp
- In case of creating/deleting a record, field name, old value and new value would be null in the record since the operation is on the whole record and not a specific column

### Approvals
- When an action requires authorization, a verification code must be supplied to confirm that approval has been given. The system should validate that the person providing this approval has the appropriate user permissions or authority level to grant such authorization.
- Self-Approval Restriction: If an action requires approval from an individual with a certain role, and the person requesting the action has that same role, they cannot grant the approval to themselves and must obtain approval from another individual with the required role or authority level.
