Currently there is no one assigned to this incident, therefore you have to ensure that active agent with email 'mackenzie.thompson@mcdonald.com' from the same company takes over this case. She needs a critical-priority task with the description 'It is necessary to recover the account for the VIP user' and a separate change request with the same level of priority, a risk_level of 'medium' and a note 'Urgent help needed for VIP client' to this incident. Finally, you need to leave a private note on this incident with a comment 'The client whose account was blocked turned out to be a VIP, so it is urgently necessary to help him unblock his account since it was not intentional that he was blocked.'",
