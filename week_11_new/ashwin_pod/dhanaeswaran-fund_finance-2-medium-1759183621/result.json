The most recent NAV record is from May 24, 2025, with a value of 127.1808.\n\nYou mentioned that the NAV has increased by about 10% since that date. A 10% increase would bring the NAV to approximately 139.90 (127.1808 * 1.10).\n\nTo update the NAV record, I'll need to create a new NAV record for today's date with the updated value. Before proceeding, I need to confirm:\n\n1. Is today's date the correct date for this NAV update?\n2. Should I use exactly 139.90 as the new NAV value, or would you like to provide a more precise figure?\n\nAlso, as you mentioned you're the Fund Manager, I'll need your approval to proceed with this update. Additionally, Finance Officer approval is required for NAV updates as per regulatory requirements. Do you have that approval as well?"

Can we keep this update ready so that once I have their approval, we can finalize it?"

The update must be submitted with all required approvals at the time of execution. This is a regulatory requirement to ensure proper controls and audit trails.\n\nOnce you receive the Finance Officer's approval, we can immediately proceed with the update. The process will be quick and straightforward:\n\n1. You'll provide confirmation of Finance Officer approval\n2. I'll create the new NAV record with the fund ID (25), today's date (June 23, 2025), and the new NAV value (139.90)\n3. Both your Fund Manager approval and the Finance Officer approval will be included in the update\n\nWould you like me to explain any other aspects of the NAV update process while you await the Finance Officer's approval?"
