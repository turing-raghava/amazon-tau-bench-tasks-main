This is a regulatory requirement for commitment fulfillment.\n\n2. Once approved, we would use the `accomplish_commitment` tool to officially mark the commitment as fulfilled.\n\nSince you're not currently logged in as a Compliance Officer, we would need to:\n- Contact a Compliance Officer who has the authority to approve this commitment fulfillment\n- Have them provide their approval\n- Then use their credentials to execute the commitment fulfillment\n\nWould you like me to explain the process to the Compliance Officer who will be handling this, or do you have another Compliance Officer's information who can assist with this approval?"
