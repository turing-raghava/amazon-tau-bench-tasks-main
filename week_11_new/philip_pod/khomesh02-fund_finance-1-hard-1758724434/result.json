Here's how you can obtain these confirmations:\n\n1. **Fund Manager Approval**: Contact your organization's Fund Manager directly. They need to explicitly approve this price update by confirming they've reviewed and authorized the changes.\n\n2. **Compliance Officer Approval**: Similarly, reach out to your organization's Compliance Officer who must also review and approve this price modification.\n\nBoth approvals are mandatory for any price updates due to regulatory requirements in financial systems. These approvals ensure proper oversight and compliance with financial reporting standards.\n\nOnce you have explicit confirmation from both parties (typically in the form of signed authorization or documented approval), you can return with that information, and I can help you complete the price update.\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific part of this approval process in more detail?"
