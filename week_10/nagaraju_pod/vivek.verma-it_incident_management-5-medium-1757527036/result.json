        "content": "# IT Incident Management Policies\n\n## Overview\n\nThis document outlines the general policies and procedures for managing IT incidents within our organization. These policies ensure consistent, efficient, and effective incident resolution while maintaining security and service quality standards.\n\n## 1. Incident Security and Password Management Policy\n\n### Data Breach Response Protocol\n\n- **High Priority Classification**: All data breaches involving compromised passwords must be classified as high priority incidents\n- **Mandatory Task Creation**: Before performing any password resets, a formal task must be created with the description \"Resetting passwords for affected users\"\n- **Documentation Requirements**: All password reset activities must be documented with public comments stating \"Passwords Reset for affected users, and an email will be sent for changing the passwords to their inboxes\"\n- **External Coordination**: For ongoing security concerns, coordinate with external security vendors through designated department liaisons\n- **Timeline Requirements**: All security-related tasks must be completed within the specified timeframe (e.g., before 6 PM on the due date)\n\n### Password Reset Workflow\n\n1. Create incident task for password reset with proper description\n2. Identify all affected users in the compromised department\n3. Execute password resets for all affected agents\n4. Add public comment documenting the action taken\n5. Mark the password reset task as completed\n6. Assign follow-up tasks for external vendor coordination if needed\n\n## 2. SLA Management and Categorization Policy\n\n### Incident Categorization Requirements\n\n- **Proper Category Assignment**: All incidents must be correctly categorized to ensure appropriate SLA policies are applied\n- **Category Validation**: SLA admins must verify incident categories and modify if incorrect assignments are identified\n- **Subcategory Creation**: Create relevant subcategories when they don't exist (e.g., VPN under Network category)\n\n### SLA Policy Standards\n\n- **High Priority Network Issues**:\n  - Response time: 30 minutes maximum\n  - Resolution time: 240 minutes maximum\n- **SLA Modification Process**:\n  1. Identify incorrect categorization\n  2. Create appropriate categories/subcategories if needed\n  3. Create or update SLA policy with proper response and resolution times\n  4. Attach updated SLA to the incident\n  5. Add comment \"Incident SLA Modified\"\n  6. Log all incident changes for audit purposes\n\n## 3. Incident Reporting and Assignment Policy\n\n### Incident Creation Standards\n\n- **Descriptive Titles**: Use clear, specific titles that describe the issue (e.g., \"Error 504 at Checkout\")\n- **Detailed Descriptions**: Include specific error messages, order numbers, or system references\n- **Evidence Attachment**: Attach relevant screenshots or documentation as evidence\n- **Priority Classification**: Assign appropriate priority levels based on business impact\n\n### Agent Assignment Protocol\n\n- **Preferred Agent Requests**: Users may request specific agents who have handled similar issues previously\n- **Department-Based Assignment**: Consider the reporter's department when assigning incidents\n- **Experience Matching**: Assign agents with relevant experience for specific incident types\n\n### Required Information for New Incidents\n\n- Title and detailed description\n- Category and subcategory\n- Reporter information (user ID, company, department)\n- Priority level\n- Assigned agent (if specified)\n- Supporting evidence/attachments\n\n## 4. Task Management and Resolution Policy\n\n### Task Completion Requirements\n\n- **Status Updates**: All assigned tasks must be properly marked as \"done\" upon completion\n- **Documentation**: Create tasks for all work performed, even if not initially planned (e.g., testing activities)\n- **Timeline Adherence**: High-priority tasks require immediate attention with appropriate due dates\n- **Public Communication**: Add public comments to inform stakeholders of completion status\n\n### Incident Resolution Process\n\n1. Complete all assigned tasks and mark them as done\n2. Create additional tasks for any unplanned work performed\n3. Verify all tasks are completed before resolving the incident\n4. Update incident status to \"resolved\"\n5. Add final comment \"All tasks completed\"\n6. Link relevant knowledge base articles for future reference\n7. Log all incident changes\n\n### Knowledge Base Integration\n\n- **Article Linking**: Associate incidents with relevant knowledge base articles that match the same categorization\n- **Future Reference**: Ensure similar incidents can be resolved using documented solutions\n\n## 5. Quality Assurance and Continuous Improvement Policy\n\n### Recurring Incident Analysis\n\n- **Pattern Recognition**: Monitor incidents in the same category and subcategory for recurring issues\n- **Threshold Monitoring**: When incident count exceeds 5 in the same category, create knowledge base documentation\n- **Knowledge Base Creation**: Document solutions with clear, actionable descriptions\n- **Incident Linking**: Link knowledge base articles to resolved incidents for reference\n\n### Customer Satisfaction Monitoring\n\n- **CSAT Analysis**: Regularly review Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) ratings for agents\n- **Performance Standards**: Maintain CSAT ratings above 3.0\n- **Low Rating Investigation**: When CSAT falls to 3 or below, review and list all low-rated incidents for improvement analysis\n\n### Knowledge Base Standards\n\n- **Clear Instructions**: Document fixes with specific steps and timing (e.g., \"wait 5 minutes and retry, doing this up to 3 times\")\n- **Category Matching**: Ensure knowledge base articles match incident categories and subcategories\n- **Regular Updates**: Keep knowledge base current with latest solutions and procedures\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n### Communication Standards\n\n- Use clear, professional language in all comments and documentation\n- Ensure public comments are informative and helpful to all stakeholders\n- Maintain transparency in incident resolution progress\n\n### Audit and Compliance\n\n- Log all incident changes with user identification\n- Maintain proper task and incident status tracking\n- Ensure all policies are followed consistently across all incident types\n\n### Emergency Procedures\n\n- High-priority and critical incidents require immediate attention\n- Security-related incidents follow enhanced documentation and notification procedures\n- Escalation paths must be clearly defined and followed\n\n---\n\n_This document should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure policies remain current with organizational needs and industry best practices._\n"
